# Simple File System
### UVic CSC 360, Spring 2019

This directory is for the CSC 360 Assignment of a ~Little Log File System~ Simple File System.

Note: an LFS proved difficult for the time constraints of the assignment so a simple Unix-like FS was made instead.

Trade-offs:
1. No searching through multiple block pointers -- not enough time to implement
